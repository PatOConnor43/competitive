Given a string of lowercase alphabets, count all possible substrings (not necessarily distinct) that have exactly k distinct characters.

Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of two lines. The first line of each test case consists of a string S.
The second line of each test case contains integer K.

Output:

Corresponding to each test case, in a new line, print the count all possible substrings that has exactly k distinct characters.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= string length <= 1000
1 <= K <= 26

Example:
