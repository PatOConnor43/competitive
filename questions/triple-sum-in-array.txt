Given an array A[] of n numbers and another number x, determine whether or not there exist three elements in A[] whose sum is exactly x.

Expected time complexity is O(n^2).

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is n and x, n is the size of array.
The second line of each test case contains n integers representing array elements C[i].

Output:

Print 1 if there exist three elements in A whose sum is exactly x, else 0.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 200
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000

Example:

Input:
2
6 13
1 4 45 6 10 8
5 10
1 2 4 3 6

Output:
1
1
